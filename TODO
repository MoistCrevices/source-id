TODO list for completing the source-id feature
----------------------------------------------

* adding file hash for each source file to th debug info.
  This filename are already there in .debug_str section.
  (http://dwarfstd.org/doc/DWARF4.pdf)
* add file hash validation in GDB. This is superior over the mtime check
  that exists today in GDB.
* change source paths in debug info to repository path.
  The problem is that the paths can be an absolute path, so contains a partial
  path with is not part of the repository path. This should be stripped which
  is done at the moment by the fetch_source script.
  There may be the case that the path is too short (I'm not sure), in this case
  we need to ensure that the relative path from the repository top-level
  directory gets prepended to the filename.
